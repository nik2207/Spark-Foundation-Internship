# Spark-Foundation-Internship
This repository contains tasks completed as part of the Spark Foundation Internship. Each task involves data analysis, prediction, or visualization to demonstrate skills in data science and machine learning.
Task 1: Predict the Percentage of a Student Based on Study Hours
Objective: Predict the score percentage of a student based on the number of hours they studied.
Approach: Implement a linear regression model to analyze the relationship between study hours and percentage score.
Dataset: Provided dataset with student hours and scores.

Task 2: Prediction Using Unsupervised Machine Learning
Objective: From the given 'Iris' dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and visualize the results.
Approach: Use k-means clustering to identify clusters within the Iris dataset and represent them visually using plots.
Dataset: Iris dataset.

Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail
Objective: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a retail dataset to identify trends and patterns in sales.
Approach: Utilize data visualization techniques to analyze sales, profits, and other metrics, identifying key insights and anomalies.

Dataset: Retail dataset.
Task 4: Exploratory Data Analysis - Global Terrorism
Objective: Analyze the global terrorism dataset to uncover patterns and trends in terrorist activities worldwide.
Approach: Use various EDA techniques, such as bar charts and heatmaps, to identify significant findings and regional trends.
Dataset: Global Terrorism dataset.

Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis - Indian Premier League (IPL)
Objective: Perform EDA on the 'Indian Premier League' dataset to explore insights related to team performance, player statistics, and match outcomes.
Approach: Use data visualizations to analyze player performances, winning teams, and other IPL-related statistics.
Dataset: Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset.
